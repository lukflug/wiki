<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>x86</strong> is a backwards compatible family of little-endian, complex instruction
set architectures (ISA) introduced in 1978 by Intel.
The two preeminent manufacturers of CPUs implementing x86 are Intel and AMD.
The iterations of the ISA can be broadly classified by integer width:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>16-bit x86, also referred to as <strong>IA-16</strong>, <strong>x86-16</strong> or <strong>x86_16</strong> (introduced
with the Intel 8086 in 1978)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32-bit x86, also referred to as <strong>IA-32</strong>, <strong>x86-32</strong> or <strong>x86_32</strong> (introduced
with the Intel 386 in 1985)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>64-bit x86 (not to be confused with IA-64), also referred to as <strong>x86-64</strong>,
<strong>x86_64</strong>, <strong>AMD64</strong> or <strong>x64</strong>.
It is also referred to as <strong>EM64T</strong>, <strong>IA-32e</strong> or <strong>Intel64</strong> by Intel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_history">1. History</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_first_generation">1.1. First generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first iteration of the x86 architecture was introduced in 1978 with the
<strong>Intel 8086</strong>.
The 8086 was a 16-bit CPU, with 16-bit registers, a 16-bit data bus and a
20-bit address bus.
Thus it was able to address one megabyte of RAM.
Although the 8086 had no binary compatibility with the 8080 or 8085, the design
was such, that all 8080 or 8085 programs could be machine translated to work on
the 8086.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Slightly later, the <strong>Intel 8088</strong> CPU was introduced, which was internally
identical to the 8086, but had a 8-bit data bus.
The 8088 was used by the original IBM PC, introduced in 1981, which was the
predecessor of all modern PCs.
Thus, the x86 architecture became the dominant architecture on personal
computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intel also introduced the <strong>Intel 8087</strong> FPU that provides floating-point
capabilities, and operated in parallel to the main processor.
The Intel 8089 IOP (I/O processor) was also introduced to allow fast I/O
operations without CPU supervision, allowing for an increasing degree of
parallelism.
However, the IBM PC did not use the 8089, instead using the simpler Intel 8237
(designed for the 8-bit 8085).
This meant that no successor to the 8089 was ever made.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_second_generation">1.2. Second generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1982, Intel introduced the <strong>Intel 80186</strong>), <strong>Intel 80188</strong> and <strong>Intel 80286</strong>
(also known as the 186, 188 and 286 respectively).
The 186 and 188 were similar to the 8086 and 8088 respectively, but were
intended for embedded systems, and included peripherals that were not compatible
with IBM PCs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much later, the <strong>Intel 80187</strong> (also known as the 187) was introduced as a
math coprocessor compatible the 186, but not the 188.
The 187 was internally more similar to the 387 and supported all the 387
instructions and was IEEE 754 compliant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 286, however, was intended for multi-user, multitasking environments.
Thus the 286 introduced features for multitasking and memory protection and was
able to address up to 16 MiBs of RAM.
To preserve compatibility with the 8086, most of the features introduced with
the 286 could only be used in a mode called <em>protected mode</em>.
The 286 and most subsequent x86 processors start in <em>real mode</em>, which emulates
the behavior of a 8086.
The 286 started to gain wide adoption with the introduction of the IBM AT in
1984.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The math coprocessor for the 286 is the <strong>Intel 80287</strong> (also known as the 287).
A later version of the 287, known as the 287XL, was internally similar to the
387SX.
The 287 is also compatible with the 386DX and 386SX.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_nec_v20">1.3. NEC V20</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>NEC V20</strong> was a pin compatible replacement for the 8088, that was a very
popular upgrade for XT-class machines, due to being able to execute more
instructions on average in a smaller amount of time.
Variants included the <strong>NEC V30</strong>, which was pin compatible with the 8086, the
<strong>NEC V40</strong>, which corresponded to the 188, and the <strong>NEC V50</strong>, which corresponded
to the 186.
The <strong>NEC V33</strong> and its variant, the <strong>NEC V53</strong>, is a V30 variant with performance
equivalent to a 286 and can address up to 16 MiB of memory.
The <strong>NEC V25</strong> and <strong>NEC V35</strong> are microcontroller variants of the V20 and V30
respectively.
The later V60 series implemented a different ISA, but had a V20 emulation mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these CPUs supported the 186 instruction set and new instructions
exclusively available on NEC CPUs.
Among other things, these instructions included nibble and bitwise operations.
The V25 and V35 implemented additional enhancements, such as eight register
banks for interrupt handling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The V33 and V53 implemented <strong>expanded addressing mode</strong>, which allows the use of
up to 16 MiB of RAM.
This mode is essentially real mode with paging of 16 kiB pages.
The translation table translating the 20-bit linear address to a 24-bit
physical address is mapped to the I/O ports 0xFF00 to 0xFF7F.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_third_generation">1.4. Third generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1985, Intel introduced the <strong>386DX</strong>.
This new iteration introduced support for 32-bit integers and extended
protected mode to introduce, among other things, paging and support for up to
4 GiBs of RAM.
Later, Intel introduced the <strong>386SX</strong>, which was internally similar to the 386DX,
but had a 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus, rather than 32-bit busses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1987, the <strong>387DX</strong> was introduced.
Due to its 32-bit data bus, it was incompatible with the 386SX, which had its
own math coprocessor called the <strong>387SX</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fourth_generation">1.5. Fourth generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1989, the <strong>Intel 486DX</strong> was introduced, introducing new features, such as
tightly coupled (i.e. true) pipelining and an integrated FPU.
The <strong>486SX</strong> variant was a version without an integrated FPU.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
A <strong>487SX</strong> math coprocessor upgrade was available for 486SX systems.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fifth_generation">1.6. Fifth generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1993, the <strong>Intel Pentium</strong> was introduced, featuring the new <strong>P5</strong> (also known
as <strong>i586</strong>) microarchitecture, which introduced superscalar architecture, a
64-bit external data bus and branch prediction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sixth_generation">1.7. Sixth generation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Pentium was followed up by the Pentium Pro in 1995, which was the first
implementation of the <strong>P6</strong> (also known as <strong>i686</strong>) microarchitecture,
introducing register renaming, out-of-order execution, speculative execution
and a 36-bit address bus, that allowed for up to 64 GiBs of RAM, that could be
accessed through PAE or PSE-36.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intel’s competitors also started building their chips on their own, unique,
in-house designs, such as the AMD K5 (introduced in 1996) and the Cyrix 5x86
(1995) and 6x86 (1996), rather than trying to replicate Intel’s chips, or
orient their designs around them, as with the Am486 and Am5x86 and the Cx486.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_x86_64">1.8. x86-64</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first processor to implement <strong>x86-64</strong>, a 64-bit extension originally
proposed by AMD in 1999, was the AMD Opteron, introduced in 2003.
Aside from increasing the size and count of general-purpose and SSE registers,
it introduced 64-bit linear addresses, albeit the paging scheme restricts the
virtual address space to 48 bits (splitting it into to halves through sign
extension).
In addition, many legacy features, such as certain aspects of segmentation,
have been removed.
To maintain backwards compatibility these new features can only be used in
long mode.
The behavior compatible with older CPUs (i.e. real and protected mode) are
available in legacy mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this day, every properly-implemented x86 processor has a large degree of
binary backwards compatibility, all the way back to the original Intel 8086.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_operating_modes">2. Operating modes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>x86 has a handful of operating modes.
On x86-64 processors, real mode and protected mode are group together into
legacy mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_real_mode">2.1. Real mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Real mode</strong> is the operating mode that an x86 processor boots into.
It mostly models the original 16-bit 8086 processor, with a few extensions.
Real mode contains no access rings or memory protection of any kind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access to memory is done via a 16-bit segment selector and a 16-bit offset
address, using following formula:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code><table class="linenotable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><pre><span></span>physical_address = segment * 16 + offset
</pre></td></tr></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default operand and address size is 16-bit.
The segment limit is 65536 bytes (64 kiB), this means even when using a 32-bit
address size prefix, the offset may not exceed 65535.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to these limitations, software in real mode can only directly access the
first 1114096 (1 MiB + 64 kiB - 16 bytes) of physical memory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code><table class="linenotable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><pre><span></span>65535 * 16 + 65536 = 1114096
</pre></td></tr></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_unreal_mode">2.1.1. Unreal mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Unreal mode</strong>, also known as <strong>flat real mode</strong>, <strong>32-bit real mode</strong> or
<strong>voodoo mode</strong>, is an originally undocumented variant of real mode that alters
the segment descriptor cache, in order to allow 32-bit offsets, so that
programs may access up to 4 GiB of memory.
Unreal mode is available on the 386 and above.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_big_real_mode">Big real mode</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Big real mode</strong>, also known as <strong>big unreal mode</strong>, sets the limit of data
segments to 4 GiB, allowing for a flat 32-bit physical address space
starting from zero, if selector zero is used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_huge_real_mode">Huge real mode</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Huge real mode</strong>, also known as <strong>huge unreal mode</strong>, sets the limit of code
segments to 4 GiB, in addition to changing the data segment limit.
However, the high 16 bits of <code>eip</code> are not saved by real mode interrupts,
making it difficult to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_protected_mode">2.2. Protected mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Protected mode</strong> was introduced with the 286 and provides memory protection.
Unlike real mode, there is no linear relationship between segment selector and
segment base address.
The segment base address and other properties of each segment are determined by
the global descriptor table (GDT) and local descriptor table (LDT).
The segment selector is essentially an index to a segment descriptor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Protected mode provides four protection rings, Ring 0 being the most privileged
and Ring 3 being the least privileged.
Most operating systems only use Ring 0 and Ring 3.
Code running in Ring 0 may access any segment and may interface directly with
hardware.
The privileges of other Rings depend on the GDT and LDT and the state of the
CPU.
Ring 0 is often referred to as "kernel mode" and Ring 3 is often referred to as
"user mode".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 286 originally allowed for up to 16 MiB of RAM, however extensions to
protected mode introduced with the 386 increased this to 4 GiB.
The 386 also introduced optional paging to protected mode, allowing for an
extra level of translation after segmentation.
Later extensions, such as PAE and PSE-36, increase the maximum size of physical
memory to beyond 4 GiB.
However, the size of virtual address space is still limited to 4 GiB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the <strong>logical address</strong>, consisting of segment selector and offset is first
translated to a <strong>linear address</strong>, by adding the segment base address of the
corresponding segment descriptor to the offset.
If paging is enabled, the linear address is translated to a <strong>physical address</strong>,
otherwise the linear address corresponds to the physical address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Protected mode has two sub-modes, depending on the current code segment.
However, 16-bit and 32-bit segment descriptors may coexist in the same
descriptor table.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_16_bit_protected_mode">2.2.1. 16-bit protected mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current code segment is a 16-bit segment, the default address and
operand size is 16-bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code targeting real mode is largely compatible with 16-bit protected mode,
assuming, among other things, it does not attempt to do any privileged
operation, does not assume that there is a direct relationship between segment
base and segment selector (as is the case in real mode) and does not try to
modify code or execute data.
In practice, most existing real mode programs do at least one of the things
listed above, rendering them incompatible with 16-bit protected mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_32_bit_protected_mode">2.2.2. 32-bit protected mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current code segment is a 32-bit segment, the default address and
operand size is 32-bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>32-bit addressing allows for up to 4 GiB of directly addressable RAM, rather
than 64 kiB, as is the case with 16-bit addressing.
This, along with paging, largely removes the necessity for multiple segments,
as modern operating systems mostly rely on paging and have one code segment and
one data segment per Ring per virtual address space, usually having the base
zero.
To a 32-bit user program, segmentation is essentially transparent and the
address space consists of 4 GiB of flat, contiguous memory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_virtual_8086_mode">2.2.3. Virtual 8086 mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Virtual 8086 mode</strong> was introduced with the 386 and allows the execution of
real mode programs in a virtual machine under a hypervisor in protected mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_system_management_mode">2.3. System management mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introduced with the 386SL (a CPU targeting laptops), system management mode is
mostly transparent to the operating system.
System management mode is intended for firmware to provide functions, such as
power management, independently from the operating system that is currently
running.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_long_mode">2.4. Long mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Long mode</strong> was introduced with x86-64 and allows software to use 64-bit
address and data.
Linear addresses are now 64-bit, thus allowing for a virtual address space of
up to 16 EiB.
The paging scheme restricts this to 48-bit, however, with the remaining bits
being sign extended, thus producing two halves of 128 TiB of "canonical address
space".
An address that complies with this sign extension requirement is said to be in
<strong>canonical form</strong>.
The half starting at zero is called the (canonical) <strong>lower half</strong>.
The half starting at 16 EiB - 128 TiB is called the (canonical) <strong>upper half</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If 5-level paging (also known as LA57) is enabled, the canonical address space
is extended to 57-bit, thus extending the maximum amount of virtual memory from
256 TiB to 128 PiB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much like protected mode, long mode has three sub-modes depending on the
current code segment.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_64_bit_mode">2.4.1. 64-bit mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current code segment is 64-bit, the code will be interpreted as 64-bit
code and 64-bit registers may be used.
Many legacy features of protected mode, such as segmentation, are largely
disabled.
<code>cs</code>, <code>ds</code>, <code>es</code> and <code>ss</code> always have base zero, while <code>fs</code> and <code>gs</code> may have
a non-zero base.
No segment limit checks are performed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compatibility_mode">2.4.2. Compatibility mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>16-bit and 32-bit segments may coexist with 64-bit segments and are meant to
provide compatibility with protected mode user programs.
Segmentation works like in protected mode, but many features only directly
visible to the operating system, such as paging, system calls and interrupt,
work as they do in 64-bit mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certain features, such as virtual 8086 protected mode, no longer work under
compatibility mode.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_16_bit_compatibility_mode">16-bit compatibility mode</h5>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>Every instruction involving memory has a default segment and most may be

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of the computation is called the <strong>effective address</strong> (one may write
<code>[base + index + displacement]</code> to refer to the corresponding memory address,

The default segment is <code>ds</code>, except when the base is <code>bp</code>, in which case it is

MMX supported only integer math and operated on aliases to the 64-bit
significand part of the x87 registers, called <code>mm0</code> to <code>mm7</code>.
Unlike x87, MMX can addresses those registers directly, without a stack
pointer.
This aliasing makes it difficult for applications to use MMX and x87 at the

2001.
In addition to adding new instructions to the existing MMX integer instruction

SSE2 adds support for 64-bit floating-point numbers and integers of sizes
ranging from 8-bit to 64-bit, through MMX-like instructions on SSE registers.
Thus, it is a full replacement of MMX and a partial replacement for x87 (though
x87 supports higher precision 80-bit floating-point math).</p>
